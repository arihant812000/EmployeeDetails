Hello Everyone....
I have prepared a basic requirements which you need to implement for the Employee project

 

Employee:
First Name
Last Name
Date of Birth
Age - Calculate based on the DOB - Read only
Email
Phone No.
Permenant Address
Current Address
Department - Dropdown
Job Role

 

Address:
House Number
Street
City
State
Country
PIN Code
Landmark

 

Employee and Address should be the 2 entities (objects). Address table should have a foreign key relationship with the Employee table.

 

Implementation Step:
1. Prepare the Database schema and get a sign off from the mentors.
2. Build API using ASP.Net and C# (API project)
3. Build front end app using Angular JS (Client project)
4. Publish the application to Azure (Optional)
